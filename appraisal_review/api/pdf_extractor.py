    """1.  **CHOICE FIELDS (e.g., "Yes/No", "did/did not")**: For fields with choices, you MUST determine which option is selected (e.g., by a checked box [X], [x], [•], [o], [v], ☒, ☑, or a plain 'x'/'X' next to or inside the option, e.g. "x did" or "did x not"). The returned value MUST start with the selected choice. If there is explanatory text immediately following the choice, append it with a colon.
        - **Example (did/did not):** For "I did did not research...", if 'did not' is checked and followed by "If not, explain: Not required", the value must be "did not: Not required".
        - **Example (Yes/No):** For "Is property seller owner of public record?", if 'Yes' is checked, the value must be "Yes".
        - **CRITICAL:**
            * Checkmarks can be represented in text as brackets containing characters (like `[X]`, `[x]`, `[o]`), unicode check boxes (☒, ☑, 🗹), or just a lone `x` / `X` positioned before, after, or between the choices (e.g., `x did did not` means `did` is checked, `did x did not` or `did did not x` means `did not` is checked).
            * If no checkbox character is visible in the raw text, look at the contextual sentences that follow. For example, if the subsequent text says "did not reveal any sales" or "no prior transfers found", the checkmark is "did not". If it says "prior sales are detailed below", then the checkmark is "did".
            * The response must begin with the selected option ("did" or "did not" or "Yes" or "No"). Do NOT return only the explanatory text. If you cannot determine the choice, return an empty string "".
    2.  **Monetary Values**: For all monetary fields (ending in '$' or 'price'), extract only the numeric value without currency symbols, commas, or decimals (e.g., '$1,250,000.50' becomes '1250000').
    3.  **Dates**: Extract all dates in 'MM/DD/YYYY' format.
    4.  **Empty Values**: If a field's value is not found or is not applicable, use an empty string `''`.
    5.  **Address Fields**: For 'Property Address', 'City', 'State', 'Zip Code', extract them as separate, distinct fields. Do not merge them.
    6.  **See attached addendum.**: for 'See attached addendum.'if the value is 'See attached addendum.' then find the comment for the relative fieldand extract it.
    7.  **Utilities**: if the Utilities like Electricity, Gas, Water, Sanitary Sewer, Street, Alley consist of the is clicked as Other (describe) or Private then find the related word and extract the value as the Private/value.
    8.  **'License Valid To'**: Check License Valid To / expiration date on the Appraiser License copy or certification page across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments). Format as MM/DD/YYYY.
    9.  **'Policy Period From'**: Check Policy Period From (effective/start date) on the E&O Insurance policy document or certificate across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments). Format as MM/DD/YYYY.
    10. **'Policy Period To'**: Check Policy Period To (expiration/end date) on the E&O Insurance policy document or certificate across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments). Format as MM/DD/YYYY.
    11. **'Appraiser License'**: Check Appraiser License number on the License copy or certification page across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments).
    12. **'E&O Insurance'**: Check E&O Insurance policy number on the E&O Insurance policy document, declaration page, or certificate across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments).
    13. **'License # / Reg #:'**: Check Appraiser License / Registration Number on the License copy or certification page across all PDF pages (including scanned image attachments).

                2. Value for each key must contain the fields listed in <fields_to_extract>.
                3. Extract each column independently. Match rows exactly with labels on the left of the grid.
                4. Extract the description (unsigned values, e.g. "Q4", "C3") into the primary key and the signed adjustment (e.g. "+5000", "-1500") into the corresponding "* Adjustment" key. If no signed value is present, use "".
                5. For Room Counts: Extract sub-columns under "Above Grade Room Count" into 'Total Rooms', 'Bedrooms', and 'Baths'. Adjustments for Bdrms and Baths go into 'Bedrooms Adjustment' and 'Baths Adjustment' respectively.
                6. For GLA/GBA: Extract area into 'Gross Living Area'/'Gross Building Area' and its adjustment into 'Gross Living Area Adjustment'/'Gross Building Area Adjustment'.
                7. For Proximity to Subject comment find out the comment from the all the pages of the report.
                8. For Unit Breakdown: Extract counts and adjustments for each unit into 'Unit Breakdown Tot Unit # [1-4]', 'Unit Breakdown Br Unit # [1-4]', 'Unit Breakdown Ba Unit # [1-4]', and 'Unit Breakdown Adjustment Unit # [1-4]'.
                9. For Prior Sales: Extract the bottom grid into prior sale keys (Date, Price, Data Source, Effective Date).
                10. Clean monetary values (digits only) and format dates (MM/DD/YYYY).
                11. For empty cells/missing data, use "".

                        -   **Column Integrity**: Data for one comparable must not leak into another.
                        -   **Row Alignment**: Match data precisely with the row labels on the left side of the grid.

                        -   **Data Cleaning**: Remove '$' and commas from monetary values. Format dates as MM/DD/YYYY.
                        -   **Missing Data**: If a cell is empty or a value cannot be found, use an empty string `""`. Do not invent data.

                You are an expert appraisal reviewer specializing in identifying discrepancies between report versions.
                Your primary goal is to meticulously compare an 'Original' and a 'Revised' appraisal report and identify all substantive changes.

                **INSTRUCTIONS:**
                1.  **Focus on Substantive Changes:** Ignore minor formatting, punctuation, or insignificant wording changes unless they alter the meaning. Focus on changes in values, facts, and appraiser comments.
                2.  **Key Areas to Compare:** Pay special attention to changes in these areas:
                    - **Subject & Contract:** Property Address, Borrower, Appraised Value, Effective Date, Contract Price, Concessions.
                    - **Sales Comparison Grid:** Any changes to the Subject or Comparables, including Sale Price, GLA, Adjustments (especially for Condition, Location, View), and final Adjusted Sale Price.
                    - **Reconciliation:** The final "Indicated Value" or "Market Value".
                    - **Cost & Income Approaches:** If present, check for changes in site value, cost estimates, or GRM.
                    - **Addenda & Comments:** Note any significant changes in text, especially in addenda or comment sections related to property condition, market analysis, or required repairs.
                3.  **Output Format:** Your response must be a single, clean JSON object with two keys: 'summary' and 'comparison_summary'. Do not include any introductory text or markdown.
                    - **`summary`**: A concise, 3-4 line executive summary of the most critical changes, such as changes in value, risk, or major property characteristics.
                    - **`comparison_summary`**: An array of objects. Each object represents a single changed field and MUST have these keys:
                        - `field`: The specific field name. For grid changes, use a format like "Comparable 1: Sale Price" or "Subject: GLA".
                        - `original_value`: The value from the 'Original' PDF. If the field was added, use "Not Present".
                        - `revised_value`: The value from the 'Revised' PDF. If the field was removed, use "Not Present".
                        - `page_no`: The page number in the 'Revised' PDF where the change is located.
                        - `comment`: A brief, insightful comment on the change. Examples: "Appraised value increased by $5,000.", "Corrected typo in borrower name.", "Comp 2 adjustment for condition changed from -$500 to $0."
                4.  **Data Cleaning:**
                    - **Monetary Values:** For all monetary fields, extract only the numeric value (e.g., '$1,250,000.50' becomes '1250000').
                    - **Dates:** Extract all dates in 'MM/DD/YYYY' format.

                You are an expert data extractor for HTML content from appraisal management systems.
                Your task is to analyze the provided HTML and extract the values for the fields listed below.
                The HTML can be messy and use tables, divs, or simple text layouts.
                Find the most likely value for each field by looking for its label.
                Return a single, clean JSON object where keys are the field names and values are the extracted text.
                If a field is not found, use an empty string `''`. Do not include markdown formatting.

                **GENERAL HTML STRUCTURE HINTS:**
                - Values often follow their labels in the next `<td>`, `<span>`, or `<div>`.
                - The label might be in a `<th>`, `<b>`, or `<strong>` tag.
                - For `<select>` elements, find the `<option>` that has the `selected` attribute and return its text content.
                - For `<input>` elements, get the `value` attribute.

                **FIELD-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION RULES:**
                - **'Client Name'**: Look for labels like 'Client/Lender on Report', 'Lender', or 'Client'. The value might be inside an `<a>` tag.
                - **'Client Address'**: Look for the address text immediately following the client name or an 'Address' label. It might be a block of text with `<br>` tags; combine it into a single line.
                - **'Transaction Type'**: Find 'Transaction Type' or 'Loan Type'. If it's a `<select>` element, get the text of the selected option.
                - **'FHA Case Number'**: Look for 'FHA Case Number' or 'FHA/VA Case #'. The value is often in an `<input>` tag.
                - **'Borrower (and Co-Borrower)'**: Find 'Borrower' or 'Applicant'. If 'Co-Borrower' is a separate field, combine them with ' & '.
                - **'Property Address'**: Find 'Property Address' or 'Subject Address'. It might be broken into multiple fields (Street, City, State, Zip); combine them into a single address string.
                - **'Property County'**: Look for 'County' or 'Property County'.
                - **'Property Type'**: Find 'Property Type'. This could be a `<select>` element or plain text.
                - **'Assigned to Vendor(s)'**: Look for 'Vendor', 'Appraiser', or 'Assigned To'. The value might be in a table with vendor details.
                - **'AMC Reg. Number'**: Find 'AMC Reg. Number' or 'AMC License #'.
                - **'Appraisal Type'**: Find 'Appraisal Type', 'Product', or 'Form'. This is often a `<select>` element.
                - **'Unit Number'**: Find 'Unit #' or 'Unit Number'. This might be part of the property address or a separate input field.
                - **'UAD XML Report'**: Look for 'UAD Compliant', 'UAD Report', or 'XML Delivery'. The value is often 'Yes', 'No', or a selected radio button/checkbox.
